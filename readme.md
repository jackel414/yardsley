# Welcome to Yardsley

Yardsley is a web app that allows users to upload products for sale and browse products uploaded by other users.

It is built using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) for the front-end and the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) on the backend. To run this app locally, follow these steps:

* Download the repository into a new directory.
* Update `db_script.php` with your local MySQL settings (you do not need to create the actual database ahead of time).
* On the command line, navigate to the directory containing your project and run `php db_script.php`.
* On the command line, run `php -S localhost:8000` to start a PHP server.
* Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

You should now see the Yardsley homepage - you're ready to get started!
